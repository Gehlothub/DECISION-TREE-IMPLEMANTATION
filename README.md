# Decision Tree Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to implement a Decision Tree classifier using the `scikit-learn` library. The project walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

##  Files

- `DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION.ipynb`: The main notebook that includes code and explanations for building a Decision Tree model.

##  Features

- Importing and preprocessing data
- Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
- Training a Decision Tree classifier using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluating the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix
- Visualizing the decision tree structure

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## ðŸ“Š Output

- Accuracy and performance metrics of the Decision Tree
- Graphical representation of the tree structure
- Confusion matrix heatmap

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Ensure your dataset (if external) is available in the correct path or modify the notebook accordingly.
- This project is intended for educational purposes and experimentation.
